_This project was created for a course at Cal Poly: Advanced Real-time Rendering. I worked in a team of four comp. sci. students, designing the game and developing the rendering engine. Key technologies I worked on include: deferred rendering, HUD, particle system._

The project can be viewed on [github](https://github.com/jjohn163/Lab1). Full implementation details can be found on the [official project website](https://jjohn163.github.io/Lab1/index.html)

> A baby goose. A dangerous cliff. And a hungry eagle.
> Help guide the chick as it falls down the cliff. Go too fast and the chick is harmed on impact with the ground. Go too slow and the eagle catches up to its delicious dinner. Bump into the rocks and branches to keep control of the speed. (Go for the branches, they won't hurt as much.) And get the chick safely to the ground.
