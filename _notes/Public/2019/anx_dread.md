ANX Dread is a virtual reality experience that explores player anxiety during task completion. A poster was published at the FDG 2019 conference.  I was the lead game designer and developer, leading a team of 5 programmers and artists. I developed the game frameworks, designing puzzles, integrating into VR, and research.
